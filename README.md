# Augment-3D-Models

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Notice:** This application was developed a long time ago and might not be compatible with the latest devices or software versions. Please be aware that it may not work as expected or at all on current devices. Feel free to explore the code, but I recommend testing it on an older Android device if you encounter issues.

Application made in Unity using C# and Google's ARCore software development kit. Users can display different 3D models in their environment using their camera and have the ability to scale, move, and rotate the 3D model as they wish.

## How to use the application
* Simply download this repository and unzip the downloaded folder
* Get your Android device (only works on an Android...üò™)
* Download the APK file from the folder to your mobile device and run the application like you do any app
